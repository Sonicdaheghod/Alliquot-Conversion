## Purpose of Program

This program is made to assist chemists in determining the volume of the aliquot needed to plate their bioassay. The calculations saves time for them since they now will not have to do the calculations by hand and will have their results provided to them in a efficient and viewable- friendly manner. In this tKinter program, I worked on the front- end aspect of the program so the users can use the application with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).

A challenge I faced was determining how to program the output box (both front- end and back- end) into my GUI. I also had issues with determining ways t make the interface appealing. In the future, I hope to recreate the application where the calculator can carry out multiple calculations besides conversions for bioassay aliquots. 

## Technologies

Languages/Enviroments used

Visual Studio Code

Python 3.10.9

## Setup

First, install Visual Studio Code here-

> https://code.visualstudio.com/download

To get Visual Studio Code working, Git must also be installed.

> https://git-scm.com/downloads

Afterwards, paste the code into the editor. Right click and press "Run Python File in Terminal"

## How to Use the Program

1. Enter the mass of a sample of your choice in milligrams (mg) and the concentration of the aliquot needed for bioassay in milligrams over milliliters (mg/ml).

2. Press the "calculate" button to receive the amount of solvent needed to make the desired concentration of the aliquot in microliters (uL).

3. The amount of solvent will show in the terminal:

### Credits
I referred to the links below to create my spreadsheet and the widgets:

Thanks to python-course for providing the base code for setting up the vidual and functionality aspects of the input and output buttons.
