## Purpose of Program

This program is made to assist chemists in determining the volume of the aliquot needed to plate their bioassay. The calculations saves time for them since they now will not have to do the calculations by hand and will have their results provided to them in a efficient and viewable- friendly manner. In this tKinter program, I worked on the front- end aspect of the program so the users can use the application with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).

A challenge I faced was determining how to program the output box (both front- end and back- end) into my GUI. I also had issues with determining ways t make the interface appealing. In the future, I hope to recreate the application where the calculator can carry out multiple calculations besides conversions for bioassay aliquots. 

## Technologies

### Credits
I referred to the links below to create my spreadsheet and the widgets:

Thanks to python-course for providing the base code for setting up the vidual and functionality aspects of the input and output buttons.
