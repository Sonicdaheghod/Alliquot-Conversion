# **Alliquot-Conversion Calculator**

## **Purpose of the program**

#This program is made to assist chemists in determining the volume of the alliquot needed to plate their bioassay. The calculations saves time for them since they now will not have to do the calculations by hand and will have their results provided to them in a efficient and viewable- friendly manner. One of the challanges I faced when creating this program were including having the user to retype their input if they didn't type a numerical value. In the future, I hope to include a feature where if the user does not type a numerical value for one of the questions in the program created for a TypeError/ ValueError.

## **Example of how to use the program**

Say that you are a chemist who knows what the mass of their crude extract is and what concentration the alliquot must be at in the well plate. They also know how many fractions they want to calculate for. So, they would type this information as shown below:

```
How many fractions do you have? 2
Enter the mass of your sample (in g): 2.3
What concentration do you need to dilute your sample in? (mg/ml) 3
